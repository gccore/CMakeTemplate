CMake Template
==============

  Just a bunch of my frequently used CMake configurations.

  ./Configs: Contains the configurations.
      /SharedLibrary: Contains the most common setup for a shared library.
      /Executable: Contains the most common setup for a executable project.
      /QtCreatorPlainCppCMake: QtCreator's Plain C++ project template.
  ./DeveloperTest: The developers test for the configurations.
