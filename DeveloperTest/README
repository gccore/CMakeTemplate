CMakeTemplate/DeveloperTest
===========================

  This project is the tool that I use to develop the configs.
  
Adding New Config
=================

  Just create its directory and put the CMake config into it.
  The root CMake will create an option for it and you could
  enable it, after that every time when you run CMake it will
  copy the config into ../Configs/[YourConfigDirectoryName]/
